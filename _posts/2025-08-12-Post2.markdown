As much as we have talked about how important time management it still seems to be one of the most complicated subjects for me. I struggle with not having enough time in the day to research topics and intergrating them into my projects. I've learned that allotting extra time between my tasks is crucial to success. Usually I do not give myself enough time between my jobs to focus on schoolwork. If I segment my days more I should have enough space in between to really implement what we are learning into the projects.
